## Introduction

Recent works demonstrate the feasibility of enhancing visual representations with generative models, where generative models take visual tokens as conditions and perform reconstruction. However, the underlying principle remains underexplored.

We empirically reveal that perfect generation (reconstruction) does not always yield desirable visual representasions, as shown below:

In this work, we delve into three aspects to explore the critical factors: (1) conditioning mechanisms, (2) denoising configurations and (3) generation paradigms.

We propose a two-stage post-training method to enhance CLIP ViT's fine-grained visual representations, which is efficient (with only lightweight denoisers) and versatile (applicable to both continuous and discrete denoisers). The pipeline of our method is illustrated below:

> [!Important]
>
> We empirically found that, for visual representations, a *visually* perfect generative model is not optimal and not necessary. 
>
> Our method only employs lightweight generative models and does not require any pre-trained weights, which is efficient and  could avoid potential privacy and copyright issues.

## TODOs

- [ ] Release training code of continuous denoisers.
- [ ] Release training code of discrete denoisers.



## Acknowledgements

When building the codebase of continuous denosiers, we refer to [x-flux](https://github.com/XLabs-AI/x-flux). Thanks for their wonderful project. Notably, we do NOT use their pre-trained weights.
